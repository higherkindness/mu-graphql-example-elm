# mu-graphql-example-elm ðŸŒ³

![Elm CI]

![preview]

To run this example, you need to run the [Mu-Haskell] GraphQL server example (with [Stack]):

```sh
$ stack run library
```

And, in another terminal, this project:

```sh
# Fetch schema and save it to file
$ npm install
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/higherkindness/mu-haskell/master/examples/library/library.graphql > library.graphql
$ npm run codegen
$ npm start
```

## This example demonstrates

- [x] Queries
   - How to combine queries and selection sets (search authors by name and books by title)
   - How to handle errors and loading state
- [x] Mutations
   - How to create a new entity related to an existing one (submit a book with an existing author)
   - How to compose Tasks to create several new entities with relations (submit a book with a new author)
- [ ] Subscriptions

## This app does not demonstrate:

- User input ~~validation~~ parsing best practices
- Routing best practices
- Debouncing user input
- Client-side validation before submitting a form

## Other technical notes:

- [elm-graphql] also supports code-generation from introspection files, local schema files, and remote servers with introspection enabled _(it usually is)_.
- In this particular example, it's better for us to use exactly that schema file, which was used for implementing backend, rather than keeping a duplicate schema in the client repo (in this case someday they will become inconsistent). However, in real applications, it could be great to have both backend and client code located in one repo together with the schema.
- both [elm-graphql] and [elm-app] can be installed as global dependencies, but we don't consider it a good practice, because it immediately becomes harder to maintain versions.
- old generated files are removed by [elm-graphql] automatically, we don't need to worry about it.
- `curl` is not supported on Windows systems, but you can download the schema file manually.
